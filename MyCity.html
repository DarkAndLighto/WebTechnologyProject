                        Aleppo, commonly pronounced as /əˈlɛpoʊ/ or ə-LEP-oh (Arabic: ﺣَﻠَﺐ, ALA-LC: Ḥalab, IPA: ˈħalab), is a city in Syria, serving as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous governorate of Syria. With an estimated population of 2,098,000 residents as of 2021, it was Syria's largest city until its population was surpassed by Damascus. It's one of the largest cities in Syria's northern governorates and the Levant region.
                        Aleppo boasts a rich history as one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities globally, possibly dating back to the sixth millennium BC. Excavations reveal Amorite occupation in the third millennium BC, mentioned in cuneiform tablets from Ebla and Mesopotamia as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad, highlighting its commercial and military importance.
                        Historically, Aleppo was a major city in the Syrian region, ranking third in size within the Ottoman Empire after Constantinople (now Istanbul) and Cairo. Its strategic location at the terminus of the Silk Road, connecting the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia, contributed to its prominence. However, with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, trade shifted to sea routes, leading to Aleppo's gradual declin           
                        Following World War I, Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey and the vital Baghdad Railway link to Mosul. Additionally, it lost access to the sea via Antakya and İskenderun to Turkey in the 1940s. The rise of Damascus further diminished Aleppo's significance. Despite its decline, this situation aided in preserving Aleppo's old city, medieval architecture, and traditional heritage.
                        Aleppo earned the title of Islamic Capital of Culture in 2006 and witnessed successful restorations of its historic landmarks.

                    <div class="col-12 alp-box-description">
                        As is the case with most ancient cities, there are several theories about the name of the city mentioned in many manuscripts and ancient historical documents. Aleppo was mentioned in the Ebla tablets under the name Arman during the reign of Rimush son of Sargon the Akkadian in the third millennium BC. Some argue that it was mentioned as Aran on a stele found in Diyarbakır dating back to the third millennium BC, and named Halia in the Mari Kingdom archives (Tell al-Hariri), and was called Halabu when it was the capital of the Amorite kingdom of Yamhad around 1800 BC. Assyrian writings referred to it as Khalab and Khalwan. Aleppo was mentioned as Khurbu in Egyptian antiquities since the sixteenth century BC. Another text dating back to the reign of Ramesses II mentioned the name Khaleb, while another text from the same period mentioned Halabu, as its king lost to Ramesses II due to the intervention of the Hittite kings on the side of the Egyptians in the Battle of Kadesh.
                        The city was known as Beroe (Bere) during the Seleucid Empire following the division of Alexander the Great's empire. Some believe that Seleucus I Nicator, the founder of the Seleucid rule, named the city Berea (Beroe) in 312 BC, after his birthplace in Pella, the hometown of Philip II of Macedon, Alexander the Great's father. Aleppo retained this name throughout the Greek, Roman, and Byzantine eras.
                        Views differed regarding the name Aleppo itself, as some attributed it to the Syriac word "halba," meaning white, hence the name Halab. Others claimed that the word Halab is Aramaic and that the ancient Assyrians and Egyptians called it Halabu. One of the city's historians, Khair al-Din al-Asadi, stated that the origin of the word Aleppo dates back to "hal rab," meaning the place of gathering, where "hal" means place and "lab" means gathering, thus making the meaning of Aleppo the gathering place. The city was also mentioned as Aram Soba, as this name appeared in the Second Book of Kings in the Old Testament. As for the name "al-Shahba," some interpreted it as "shahab," meaning white interspersed with black, hence it was given this title for the whiteness of its soil and stones. Others suggest that the origin of the word al-Shahba goes back to a spotted cow that Prophet Abraham used to milk, so it was called "Halab al-Shahba." However, this suggestion has been met with criticism from historians who consider it a mere myth contrary to science and logic.
                        As for the name in foreign languages, both Alep and Aleppo are used without distinction, although Aleppo is an Italian version of the original name.

                        The city of Aleppo is characterized by a diversity of architectural styles, combining Seljuk, Byzantine, Mamluk, and Ottoman architectural influences, reflecting the various rulers who have governed the city over the years.
                        The city boasts numerous ancient buildings dating back to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries AD, such as caravanserais, religious schools, and bathhouses, in addition to religious buildings like mosques and churches. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Aleppo witnessed the construction of stone-faced mansions owned by many wealthy Aleppo families, renowned for their exquisite facades. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Baroque architecture became prevalent, exemplified by the famous Rose Villa in the Aziziyah area.
                        The upscale neighborhood of Al-Shahba combines various Eastern, Western, and even Chinese architectural styles, thanks to the skill of Aleppo's craftsmen in working with rocks, especially the white stone for which the city is renowned.

                        As an ancient city renowned for its architectural heritage, including covered markets, caravanserais, bathhouses, schools, mosques, and churches, Aleppo is a treasure trove in need of continuous care and maintenance. The city was clearly replanned after the end of World War II, and in 1954, a master plan was adopted by the French architect André Gutton, proposing the creation of several wide boulevards across the city to accommodate cars. Between 1954 and 1983, many old neighborhoods were demolished under the pretext of expansion, especially in northern areas like Bab al-Faraj and Bab Janin. However, increasing awareness of the importance of these buildings eventually led to the cancellation of Gutton's plan in 1979, replaced by a preservation plan proposed by the Swiss urban planner Stefano Bianco. Bianco's plan emphasized preserving Aleppo's old urban fabric, ultimately paving the way for UNESCO to designate the Old City of Aleppo as a World Heritage Site in 1986.
                        Numerous international institutions, in collaboration with local authorities and the Aleppo Antiquities Society, have joined forces to rehabilitate the Old City, blending modern lifestyle patterns with heritage preservation. There is a partnership between the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the Aga Khan Foundation as part of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture's program to protect ancient cities, which has contributed significantly to the preservation and rehabilitation of the Old City of Aleppo.

                    <textarea class="inf-box-description"> The Citadel of Aleppo (Arabic: قلعة حلب, romanized: Qalʿat Ḥalab) is a large medieval fortified palace in the centre of the old city of Aleppo, northern Syria. It is considered to be one of the oldest and largest castles in the world. Usage of the Citadel hill dates back at least to the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE. Occupied by many civilizations over time – including the Greeks, Armenians, Romans, Byzantines, Ayyubids, Mamluks and Ottomans  – the majority of the construction as it stands today is thought to originate from the Ayyubid period. An extensive conservation work took place in the 2000s CE by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, in collaboration with Aleppo Archeological Society. Dominating the city, the Citadel is part of the Ancient City of Aleppo, an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986 CE. During the 2010s, the Citadel received significant damage during the lengthy Battle of Aleppo. It was reopened to the public in early 2018 CE with repairs to damaged parts underway, though some of the damage will be purposefully preserved as part of the history of the citadel. The citadel was damaged by the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake.

Early Islamic period
Arab armies ruled over Aleppo in 636 CE. Written sources document repairs being made on the citadel after a major earthquake. Little is known about the citadel in the period of early Christianity and Islam, except that Aleppo was a frontier town on the edges of the Byzantine, Ummayad and Abbasid empires. Sayf al-Dawla, a Hamdanid prince, conquered the city in 944 CE, and it subsequently rose to a political and economic renaissance. The Hamdanids built a reputedly splendid palace on the banks of the river, but moved to the Citadel after Byzantine troops attacked in 962 CE. A period of instability followed Hamdanid rule, marked by Byzantine and Beduin attacks, as well as a short-term rule by the Egyptian-based Fatimids. The Mirdasids were said to have converted the two churches into mosques.

Modern day
The citadel in its present form is on a mound, which has an elliptical base with a length of 450 metres (1,480 feet) and width of 325 metres (1,066 feet). At the top this ellipse measures 285 metres (935 feet) by 160 metres (520 feet) with the height of this slanting foundation measuring 50 metres (160 feet). In the past, the entire mound was covered with large blocks of gleaming limestone, some of which still remain today. The mound is surrounded by a 22-metre-deep (72-foot) and 30-metre-wide (98-foot) moat, dating from the 12th century. Notable is the fortified gateway, accessible though an arched bridge. This feature was an addition from the Mamluk government in the 16th century CE. A succession of five right-angle turns and three large gates (with carved figures) leads to the main inner castle entrance.[17] In the interior of the Citadel, are the Weapons' Hall, the Byzantine Hall and the Throne Hall, with a restored decorated ceiling. Prior to the Syrian civil war, the citadel was a tourist attraction and a site of archaeological digs and studies. The amphitheater was often used for musical concerts or cultural events. In August 2012 CE, during the Battle of Aleppo of the Syrian Civil War, the external gate of the citadel was damaged after being shelled during a clash between the Free Syrian Army and the Syrian Army to gain control over the citadel. In July 2015 CE, a bomb was set off in a tunnel under one of the outer walls causing further damage to the citadel, in an attempt for the Free Syrian Army to dislodge the Syrian Army. During the conflict, the Syrian Army used the Citadel as a military base, and according to the opposition fighters, with the walls acting as cover while shelling surrounding areas and ancient arrow slits in walls being used by snipers to target rebels. As a result of this contemporary usage, the Citadel has received significant damage. The citadel was extensively damaged by the magnitude 7.8 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake on February 6, 2023 CE. On 17 February 2024 CE, Citadel of Aleppo was reopened after the completion of the first and second phase of the restoration of southern forward tower (the entrance to the citadel), which was greatly affected by the earthquake. Also other phases of the citadel’s restoration have been revealed, including the entrance, the minaret of Great Ayyubid Mosque, and the façade of Throne Hall.</textarea>

                    <textarea class="inf-box-description">The Great Mosque of Aleppo (Arabic: جَـامِـع حَـلَـب الْـكَـبِـيْـر, Jāmi‘ Ḥalab al-Kabīr) is the largest and one of the oldest mosques in the city of Aleppo, Syria. It is located in al-Jalloum district of the Ancient City of Aleppo, a World Heritage Site, near the entrance to Al-Madina Souq. The mosque is purportedly home to the remains of Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist, both of whom are revered in Islam and Christianity. It was built in the beginning of the 8th century CE. However, the current building dates back to the 11th through 14th centuries. The minaret in the mosque was built in 1090, and was destroyed during fighting in the Syrian Civil War in April 2013.

Founding
The site of the Great Mosque was once the agora of the Hellenistic period, which later became the garden for the Cathedral of Saint Helena during the Christian era of Roman rule in Syria. The mosque was built on land that formerly was used as the Cathedral cemetery. The church itself was left and the area became a sacred place for both religions. According to later traditions, the construction of the earliest mosque on the site was commenced by the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I in 715 and was finished by his successor Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik in 717. Architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell has attributed its construction solely to the latter, quoting 13th century Aleppine historian Ibn al-Adim who wrote Sulayman's intent was "to make it equal to the work of his brother al-Walid in the Great Mosque at Damascus". Another tradition claims al-Walid founded the mosque using materials from the so-called "Church of Cyrrus". However, architectural historian Jere L. Bacharach noted that the most likely patron of the mosque was Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik, a brother of al-Walid and Sulayman who was the governor of the local province (Jund Qinnasrin) sometime prior to 710 until at least the early period of Sulayman's rule. Accordingly, this would explain the belief that the mosque's construction took place during the reign of both caliphs. Moreover, Maslamah's governorship of Qinnasrin was largely ignored by the early Arabic historians, who focused their attention on his campaigns against the Byzantine Empire and the Armenians, and his governorship over the provinces of Iraq, Iranian Azerbaijan, Upper Mesopotamia and Armenia. Bacharach further states that Maslamah's commissioning of a large congregational mosque in Aleppo, a major base from which to attack the Byzantines, would have "been appropriate, if not necessary".

Renovation
In the second half of the 11th century, the Mirdasids controlled Aleppo and built a single-domed fountain in the mosque's courtyard. At the northwest corner of the mosque, the 45-meter high minaret was built by the Shia Muslim qadi ("chief Islamic judge") of Aleppo, Abu'l Hasan Muhammad in 1090, during the reign of Seljuk governor Aq Sunqur al-Hajib. Its construction was finished in 1094 during Tutush's rule. The architect of the project was Hasan ibn Mufarraj al-Sarmini. The mosque was restored and expanded by the Zengid sultan Nur al-Din in 1159 after a great fire that had destroyed the earlier Umayyad structure; In 1260, the mosque was razed by the Mongols. In 1281, the mosque was burned again by the Mongols, and the minbar was taken by the Armenians of Sis, according to Al-Mufaddal. The Mamluks (1260–1516) made repairs and alterations. Carved Kufic and naskhi inscriptions decorated the entire minaret along with alternate bands of stylized ornaments in patterns and muqarnas. Sultan Qalawun replaced the burnt out mihrab (niche indicating the qibla, or direction to Mecca) in 1285. Later, Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad (1293–1341) had the new minbar ("preacher's pulpit") constructed during his reign. The courtyard and minaret of the mosque were renovated in 2003.</textarea>

                    <textarea class="inf-box-description">The Church of Saint Simeon Stylites (Arabic: كنيسة مار سمعان العمودي, romanized: Kanīsat Mār Simʿān el-ʿAmūdī) is one of the oldest surviving church complexes, founded in the 5th century. It is located approximately 30 kilometres (19 mi) northwestern of Aleppo, Syria. It was constructed on the site of the pillar of Saint Simeon Stylites, a renowned stylite monk. The church is popularly known as either Qalaat Semaan (قلعة سمعان, Qalʿat Simʿān, the 'Fortress of Simeon') or Deir Semaan (دير سمعان, Dayr Simʿān, the 'Monastery of Simeon').

History
Saint Simeon was born in 386 AD in the Amanus mountains village. He entered a monastery at the age of 16, but he was judged to be unsuited for cenobitic life due to his extravagant asceticism. Following the example of Saint Anthony, he attempted to live the life of a hermit ascetic in the wilderness, but his feats of physical endurance and self-denial attracted pilgrims seeking religious instruction and other devout admirers. In an effort to escape from such distractions, he resolved to live on a small platform atop a 3-meter column. The height of the column was raised over time to 18 meters. From his perch, Simeon preached twice a day to the crowds who gathered to witness this spectacle of self-mortification. A ladder attached to the column allowed messengers to bring food and written messages to Simeon, who also sent letters to his followers this way. He became well-known enough to attract the attention of the eastern emperors Theodosius, Leo, and Theodosius III, who sought his advice and implored his intervention in state affairs. Simeon lived on the column for years, dying in AD 459 at the approximate age of 70. After a fierce contest for the possession of his remains between Antioch and Constantinople, it was settled in favor of Antioch. His remains were transported to Antioch, accompanied by a procession of the patriarch of Constantinople, 6 bishops, the Master-General of the East, 21 counts and tribunes and 6,000 soldiers. His tomb became a major pilgrimage destination. A few decades following Saint Simeon's death, a large monastic church occupying over 5,000 square meters was constructed in on the site where his pillar stood. The church was made up of four basilicas that emanated from the sides of a central octagon. The octagonal crossing was surmounted by a dome; at its center stood Simeon’s column. The church was the centerpiece of a walled monastic complex that included two minor churches, and pilgrim hostels.</textarea>

                    <textarea class="inf-box-description">Ebla (Sumerian: 𒌈𒆷 eb₂-la, Arabic: إبلا, modern: تل مرديخ, Tell Mardikh) was one of the earliest kingdoms in Syria. Its remains constitute a tell located about 55 km (34 mi) southwest of Aleppo near the village of Mardikh. Ebla was an important center throughout the 3rd millennium bc and in the first half of the 2nd millennium bc. Its discovery proved the Levant was a center of ancient, centralized civilization equal to Egypt and Mesopotamia and ruled out the view that the latter two were the only important centers in the Near East during the Early Bronze Age. The first Eblaite kingdom has been described as the first recorded world power. 

Starting as a small settlement in the Early Bronze Age (c. 3500 bc), Ebla developed into a trading empire and later into an expansionist power that imposed its hegemony over much of northern and eastern Syria. Ebla was destroyed during the 23rd century bc. It was then rebuilt and was mentioned in the records of the Third Dynasty of Ur. The second Ebla was a continuation of the first, ruled by a new royal dynasty. It was destroyed at the end of the 3rd millennium bc, which paved the way for the Amorite tribes to settle in the city, forming the third Ebla. The third kingdom also flourished as a trade center; it became a subject and an ally of Yamhad (modern-day Aleppo) until its final destruction by the Hittite king Mursili I in c. 1600 bc.</textarea>
