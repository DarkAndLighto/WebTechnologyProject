                        Aleppo, commonly pronounced as /əˈlɛpoʊ/ or ə-LEP-oh (Arabic: ﺣَﻠَﺐ, ALA-LC: Ḥalab, IPA: ˈħalab), is a city in Syria, serving as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous governorate of Syria. With an estimated population of 2,098,000 residents as of 2021, it was Syria's largest city until its population was surpassed by Damascus. It's one of the largest cities in Syria's northern governorates and the Levant region.
                        Aleppo boasts a rich history as one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities globally, possibly dating back to the sixth millennium BC. Excavations reveal Amorite occupation in the third millennium BC, mentioned in cuneiform tablets from Ebla and Mesopotamia as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad, highlighting its commercial and military importance.
                        Historically, Aleppo was a major city in the Syrian region, ranking third in size within the Ottoman Empire after Constantinople (now Istanbul) and Cairo. Its strategic location at the terminus of the Silk Road, connecting the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia, contributed to its prominence. However, with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, trade shifted to sea routes, leading to Aleppo's gradual declin           
                        Following World War I, Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey and the vital Baghdad Railway link to Mosul. Additionally, it lost access to the sea via Antakya and İskenderun to Turkey in the 1940s. The rise of Damascus further diminished Aleppo's significance. Despite its decline, this situation aided in preserving Aleppo's old city, medieval architecture, and traditional heritage.
                        Aleppo earned the title of Islamic Capital of Culture in 2006 and witnessed successful restorations of its historic landmarks.

                    <div class="col-12 alp-box-description">
                        As is the case with most ancient cities, there are several theories about the name of the city mentioned in many manuscripts and ancient historical documents. Aleppo was mentioned in the Ebla tablets under the name Arman during the reign of Rimush son of Sargon the Akkadian in the third millennium BC. Some argue that it was mentioned as Aran on a stele found in Diyarbakır dating back to the third millennium BC, and named Halia in the Mari Kingdom archives (Tell al-Hariri), and was called Halabu when it was the capital of the Amorite kingdom of Yamhad around 1800 BC. Assyrian writings referred to it as Khalab and Khalwan. Aleppo was mentioned as Khurbu in Egyptian antiquities since the sixteenth century BC. Another text dating back to the reign of Ramesses II mentioned the name Khaleb, while another text from the same period mentioned Halabu, as its king lost to Ramesses II due to the intervention of the Hittite kings on the side of the Egyptians in the Battle of Kadesh.
                        The city was known as Beroe (Bere) during the Seleucid Empire following the division of Alexander the Great's empire. Some believe that Seleucus I Nicator, the founder of the Seleucid rule, named the city Berea (Beroe) in 312 BC, after his birthplace in Pella, the hometown of Philip II of Macedon, Alexander the Great's father. Aleppo retained this name throughout the Greek, Roman, and Byzantine eras.
                        Views differed regarding the name Aleppo itself, as some attributed it to the Syriac word "halba," meaning white, hence the name Halab. Others claimed that the word Halab is Aramaic and that the ancient Assyrians and Egyptians called it Halabu. One of the city's historians, Khair al-Din al-Asadi, stated that the origin of the word Aleppo dates back to "hal rab," meaning the place of gathering, where "hal" means place and "lab" means gathering, thus making the meaning of Aleppo the gathering place. The city was also mentioned as Aram Soba, as this name appeared in the Second Book of Kings in the Old Testament. As for the name "al-Shahba," some interpreted it as "shahab," meaning white interspersed with black, hence it was given this title for the whiteness of its soil and stones. Others suggest that the origin of the word al-Shahba goes back to a spotted cow that Prophet Abraham used to milk, so it was called "Halab al-Shahba." However, this suggestion has been met with criticism from historians who consider it a mere myth contrary to science and logic.
                        As for the name in foreign languages, both Alep and Aleppo are used without distinction, although Aleppo is an Italian version of the original name.

                        The city of Aleppo is characterized by a diversity of architectural styles, combining Seljuk, Byzantine, Mamluk, and Ottoman architectural influences, reflecting the various rulers who have governed the city over the years.
                        The city boasts numerous ancient buildings dating back to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries AD, such as caravanserais, religious schools, and bathhouses, in addition to religious buildings like mosques and churches. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Aleppo witnessed the construction of stone-faced mansions owned by many wealthy Aleppo families, renowned for their exquisite facades. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Baroque architecture became prevalent, exemplified by the famous Rose Villa in the Aziziyah area.
                        The upscale neighborhood of Al-Shahba combines various Eastern, Western, and even Chinese architectural styles, thanks to the skill of Aleppo's craftsmen in working with rocks, especially the white stone for which the city is renowned.

                        As an ancient city renowned for its architectural heritage, including covered markets, caravanserais, bathhouses, schools, mosques, and churches, Aleppo is a treasure trove in need of continuous care and maintenance. The city was clearly replanned after the end of World War II, and in 1954, a master plan was adopted by the French architect André Gutton, proposing the creation of several wide boulevards across the city to accommodate cars. Between 1954 and 1983, many old neighborhoods were demolished under the pretext of expansion, especially in northern areas like Bab al-Faraj and Bab Janin. However, increasing awareness of the importance of these buildings eventually led to the cancellation of Gutton's plan in 1979, replaced by a preservation plan proposed by the Swiss urban planner Stefano Bianco. Bianco's plan emphasized preserving Aleppo's old urban fabric, ultimately paving the way for UNESCO to designate the Old City of Aleppo as a World Heritage Site in 1986.
                        Numerous international institutions, in collaboration with local authorities and the Aleppo Antiquities Society, have joined forces to rehabilitate the Old City, blending modern lifestyle patterns with heritage preservation. There is a partnership between the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the Aga Khan Foundation as part of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture's program to protect ancient cities, which has contributed significantly to the preservation and rehabilitation of the Old City of Aleppo.

                        The Citadel of Aleppo (Arabic: قلعة حلب, romanized: Qalʿat Ḥalab) is a large medieval 
                        fortified palace in the centre of the old city of Aleppo, northern Syria. It is considered 
                        to be one of the oldest and largest castles in the world. Usage of the Citadel hill dates 
                        back at least to the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE. Occupied by many civilizations over time
                        – including the Greeks, Armenians, Romans, Byzantines, Ayyubids, Mamluks and Ottomans  – 
                        the majority of the construction as it stands today is thought to originate from the Ayyubid 
                        period. An extensive conservation work took place in the 2000s CE by the Aga Khan Trust for 
                        Culture, in collaboration with Aleppo Archeological Society. Dominating the city, the Citadel 
                        is part of the Ancient City of Aleppo, an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986 CE.
                        During the 2010s, the Citadel received significant damage during the lengthy Battle of Aleppo.
                        It was reopened to the public in early 2018 CE with repairs to damaged parts underway, though 
                        some of the damage will be purposefully preserved as part of the history of the citadel.
                        The citadel was damaged by the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake.

                        and one of the oldest mosques in the city of Aleppo, Syria. It is located in al-Jalloum district of 
                        the Ancient City of Aleppo, a World Heritage Site, near the entrance to Al-Madina Souq. The mosque 
                        is purportedly home to the remains of Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist, both of whom are 
                        revered in Islam and Christianity. It was built in the beginning of the 8th century CE. 
                        However, the current building dates back to the 11th through 14th centuries. The minaret in the 
                        mosque was built in 1090, and was destroyed during fighting in the Syrian Civil War in April 2013.

                        The Church of Saint Simeon Stylites (Arabic: كنيسة مار سمعان العمودي, romanized: Kanīsat Mār 
                        Simʿān el-ʿAmūdī) is one of the oldest surviving church complexes, founded in the 5th century. 
                        It is located approximately 30 kilometres (19 mi) northwestern of Aleppo, Syria. It was constructed 
                        on the site of the pillar of Saint Simeon Stylites, a renowned stylite monk. The church is popularly 
                        known as either Qalaat Semaan (قلعة سمعان, Qalʿat Simʿān, the 'Fortress of Simeon') or Deir Semaan 
                        (دير سمعان, Dayr Simʿān, the 'Monastery of Simeon').

                        Al-Rahman Mosque or Al-Rahman Mosque is located on King Faisal Street in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
                        This mosque is distinguished by its distinctive construction method and is one of the unique 
                        mosques in construction. It is a mosque built according to modern systems on ancient Islamic 
                        architectural foundations dating back to the first Islamic eras, and this is indicated by the 
                        square minarets with quadrilateral sides. Which dates back to the Umayyad era, and some residents
                        mention that stones in the shape of pages from the Holy Qur’an were built on some of its outer 
                        walls, on which were written verses from Surat Al-Rahman.
